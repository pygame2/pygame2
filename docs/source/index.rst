   pygame2

This is a new project. There have been others like it. We hope that we
can be the first successful pygame2 project. You may be curious as to
why there is documentation available for a project that hasn't even
reached its first minor version number? We want to make sure we
establish a good development process early on so that we don't
scramble to "get it right" if and when the time comes that pygame2
catches on. We'll have documentation, test coverage and continuous
integration from day one.
