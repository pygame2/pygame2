![Travis CI Latest Build Result](https://travis-ci.org/wkmanire/pygame.svg?branch=develop)

This is a new project. There have been others like it. We hope that we
can be the first successful pygame2 project. A description of our main goals
and motivations will follow shortly.

The rect module is now complete and could potentially be used with the original
pygame (for the brave).
